# Kotlin Learning Journey

Welcome to my Kotlin learning repository! This file documents my progress, the concepts I've learned, and the projects I've built while exploring Kotlin.

## What I'm Learning
- **Kotlin Basics**: Variables, data types, and control flow.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.
- **Functional Programming**: Lambdas, higher-order functions, and immutability.
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming and concurrency.
- **Android Development**: Building Android apps using Kotlin.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Sharing code across platforms.

## Projects I've Built
1. **Simple Unit Converter**  
    A basic Unit Converter app that performs Length Conversions.

2. **To-Do List App**  
    A task management app with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

## Future Goals
- Build more advanced Android apps.
- Explore Kotlin Native for cross-platform development.
- Contribute to open-source Kotlin projects.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
